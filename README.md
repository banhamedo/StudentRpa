Student Attendance System
Overview
The Student Attendance System is designed to automate the process of tracking student attendance in classrooms or lecture halls. This system utilizes a unique ID linked to each student to record their attendance in real-time. It aims to improve accuracy, reduce human error, and save time for teachers and administrators.

Features

Real-Time Updates: The system provides up-to-date attendance information.

Custom Reports: Generates detailed attendance reports and statistics.

Attendance Pattern Analytics: Identifies students with frequent absences or tardiness.

Integration with Academic Systems: Can be linked with other systems to track academic progress and graduation requirements.

Completion Tracking: Notifies when a student completes all required courses and is eligible for graduation.

System Requirements
Backend: A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store student information and attendance records.

Frontend: A web-based or mobile interface for users to view attendance records.

Server: A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to host the application.

Programming Languages: PHP, Python, JavaScript (for the backend and frontend development).
